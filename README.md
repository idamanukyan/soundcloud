Project Description:

This project focuses on testing various functionalities of the SoundCloud web application. It utilizes Selenium WebDriver and Java to automate test scenarios that cover different aspects of the application. The following functionalities are tested:

Search Functionality: Automated tests are performed to validate the search functionality of SoundCloud. This includes submitting search queries and verifying the correctness of search results.

Filtering Search Results: Test cases are executed to verify the effectiveness of filtering search results based on different criteria such as tags, genres, or other parameters.

Track Playback: Automated tests are conducted to ensure the smooth playback of tracks. This includes initiating track playback, verifying the presence of player controls, and validating the pause functionality.

The framework follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to improve test code maintainability and reusability. Test classes are provided to cover different functionalities, and a base test class is included for easy setup and teardown of the WebDriver instance.
